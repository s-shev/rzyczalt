# Copilot Instructions for rzyczalt-2026

## Project Overview
Personal research project analyzing the Polish "ryczałt" (flat-rate) tax system. This is an early-stage project currently in initial setup.

## Tech Stack
- **Expected runtime**: Node.js/JavaScript or TypeScript (based on .gitignore patterns)
- **Project type**: Research/analysis tool for Polish tax calculations

## Development Context

### Project Purpose
This project focuses on Polish tax law, specifically the ryczałt system - a flat-rate taxation method used by small businesses and freelancers in Poland. When implementing features:
- Assume financial calculations require precision (use appropriate decimal libraries)
- Tax calculations must reference current 2026 Polish tax law
- Consider different ryczałt rates (2%, 3%, 5.5%, 8.5%, 12%, 14%, 15%, 17%) for different business activities

### Existing Reference Material
- Primary formulas and parameters are documented in [docs/tax-notes.md](docs/tax-notes.md); keep any implementation aligned with those formulas and sources.

### Code Standards
- Use clear variable names that reflect Polish tax terminology where appropriate (e.g., `przychod`, `stawkaRyczaltu`)
- Include JSDoc comments explaining tax calculation logic and legal references
- Write tests for all tax calculations to ensure accuracy

### Key Considerations
- **Precision**: Use libraries like `decimal.js` or `big.js` for financial calculations
- **Date sensitivity**: Tax rates and thresholds change yearly; make year-based calculations configurable
- **Validation**: Validate inputs against Polish business activity categories (PKD codes)

## Getting Started
When creating the initial project structure, suggest:
1. Setting up TypeScript for type safety in financial calculations
2. Organizing modules by tax calculation domain (income types, deductions, reporting)
3. Creating a data directory for storing tax rate tables and thresholds
4. Implementing unit tests from the start for calculation accuracy

## Helpful Resources
- Polish tax law uses zloty (PLN) as currency
- Ryczałt eligibility depends on annual revenue thresholds and business type
- Consider ZUS (social insurance) contributions alongside tax calculations
